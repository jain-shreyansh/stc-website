BREW 2019 was attended by over 200 inspired coders, who were taught from basics, Python, Git , Github & Flask on day one. There was also a coding contest by Code Park, which was one of the sponsors of brew. On the second day, the participants were taught about the cloud & API deployment by our guest speaker, Mr. Prateek Khandelwal. The event ended with the participants developing an actual alexa-skill.

                                        Coding Blocks in Collaboration with STC-VIT conducted this event, where the concept & application of Heaps was taught. It currently has over 5k views. Conducted by Ms.Sanjeet Bora, Instructor & Academic Advisor
                                        at Coding Blocks.
